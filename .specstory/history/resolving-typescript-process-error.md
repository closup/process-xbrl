## Resolving TypeScript 'process' Error (12/7/2024, 9:57:09 PM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find name 'process'. Do you need to install type definitions for node? Try `npm i --save-dev @types/node`.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

Run this command to install Node.js type definitions:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

This will add TypeScript type support for Node.js built-in objects like `process`.

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module '@antiwork/shortest' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

Install the package by running:

```bash
npm install @antiwork/shortest
```

If the package doesn't exist in npm registry, you'll need to get the correct package name from your project documentation or team.

Start your Next.js development server first by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Keep this running in a separate terminal, then run the shortest tests in another terminal. The error occurs because the tests are trying to access localhost:3000 but no server is running there.

You need to add the dev script to your package.json. Add this to your package.json:

```json:tsconfig.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev"
  }
}
```

Then install Next.js if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install next
```

After that, `npm run dev` should work.

The scripts section needs to be in package.json, not tsconfig.json. Create or modify your package.json:

```bash
echo '{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev"
  }
}' > package.json
```

Or manually create package.json with those contents. The scripts section doesn't belong in tsconfig.json.

---

_**Assistant**_

Since your app is a Flask app running on port 8080, you need to update your shortest.config.ts to point to the correct port. Change the test configuration to use port 8080 instead of the default 3000.

Add this to your shortest.config.ts:

```typescript
export default {
  testDir: 'app/__tests__',
  anthropicKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY || '',
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080'  // Add this line
} satisfies ShortestConfig;
```

Then run your Flask app and shortest tests in separate terminals.

_**User**_

do i need to run npm for my flask app or just do python3 main.py?

---

_**Assistant**_

For a Flask app, you only need to run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The npm/Next.js setup isn't needed since you're using Flask. You only need npm for running the shortest tests, but your actual application server is Python/Flask running on port 8080.

---

_**Assistant**_



In your shortest.config.ts, you have a typo in the configuration property. Change `baseURL` to `baseUrl` (note the lowercase 'u'):

```typescript
export default {
  testDir: 'app/__tests__',
  anthropicKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY || '',
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080'  // Changed from baseURL to baseUrl
} satisfies ShortestConfig;
```

The property name is case-sensitive, so it needs to match exactly.

ok given that i didnt need to install next but i did, how can i uninstall this?

---

_**Assistant**_



To uninstall Next.js and its related dependencies, run:

```bash
npm uninstall next @types/react
```

This will remove Next.js and the React types that were installed with it. You can also manually remove them from your package.json if they're still listed there.

in @base_page.html can you add the following text at the bottom so that it is shown on @home.html and also @upload.html 

"This product is in-development. As such, errors are to be expected along with frequent changes in functionality. This product should not be used for actual production of financial reports."

---

_**Assistant**_

Add this to base_page.html just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
    <div class="container mt-4">
        <div class="alert alert-warning text-center">
            This product is in-development. As such, errors are to be expected along with frequent changes in functionality. This product should not be used for actual production of financial reports.
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
```

This will display the warning message in a Bootstrap alert box at the bottom of both pages that extend base_page.html.

_**User**_

i want it align it to the very bottom of the page with a bit of spacing below it.

_**Assistant**_



Add this to base_page.html just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
    <div class="container mt-4 fixed-bottom mb-3">
        <div class="alert alert-warning text-center">
            This product is in-development. As such, errors are to be expected along with frequent changes in functionality. This product should not be used for actual production of financial reports.
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
```

The `fixed-bottom` class will stick it to the bottom of the viewport, and `mb-3` adds margin-bottom spacing.

            This product should not be used for actual production of financial reports.

Can you look at the conversion and IXBRL viewer code?

When I click 'Click to view in browser' and the new tab with /viewer route opens, it doesnt actually fully load the iXBRL viewer. When I terminate my application I see the following in terminal:



---

_**Assistant**_



From the error log, there are several issues with the iXBRL conversion:

1. Schema validation errors:
```
[xmlSchema:elementOccurrencesError] Sequence content occurred 0 times, minOccurs=1, maxOccurs=unbounded, within xbrli:segment
```

2. Missing required attributes:
```
[xmlSchema:attributesRequired] Element acfr:ProprietaryFundsDomain type noContent missing required attributes: contextRef
```

3. Transform value errors for numeric values:
```
[ix11.10.1.1:transformValueError] Inline element ix:nonFraction fact ... type decimal transform ixt:num-dot-decimal value error
```

The viewer not loading completely suggests that either:

1. The iXBRL file isn't being generated correctly due to these validation errors
2. The viewer resources aren't being served correctly

To debug this:

1. Check if the viewer.html file is being generated correctly in the sessions folder
2. Verify that all required viewer resources (JS files) are being copied and served
3. Add error handling in your Flask route for /viewer to catch and log any server-side errors
4. Check browser console for client-side errors when loading the viewer

Could you share the code for:
1. Your /viewer route
2. The iXBRL conversion logic
3. The viewer template/HTML

This will help identify where the viewer loading is failing.

---

_**User**_

My routes should be in @routes.py 
Creating the viewer is located in@xbrl_processing.py 
Conversion logic is located in @acfr.py and the viewer HTML is @upload.html 
]
I dont see any client-side errors in browser console when loading the viewer

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your code, I notice a few potential issues:

1. In `xbrl_processing.py`, the viewer JS file handling might be problematic:
```python
# Current path handling
viewer_js_path = os.path.join(viewer_outpath, 'ixbrlviewer.js')
destination_js_path = 'app/static/js/ixbrlviewer.js'
```

2. In your `/viewer` route, you're serving only the viewer.html file:
```python
@routes_bp.route('/viewer')
def view():
    session_id = session.get('session_id')
    session_template_path = os.path.join('static', 'sessions_data', session_id, 'output')
    full_path = os.path.join(current_app.root_path, session_template_path)
    return send_from_directory(full_path, 'viewer.html')
```

Try these fixes:

1. Modify the viewer creation in `xbrl_processing.py`:
```python
def create_viewer_html(output_file, viewer_outpath):
    viewer_filepath = os.path.join(ROOT, viewer_outpath, 'viewer.html')
    viewer_url = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ixbrl-viewer@1.4.36/iXBRLViewerPlugin/viewer/dist/ixbrlviewer.js"
    
    # Use absolute paths
    viewer_js_path = os.path.join(ROOT, viewer_outpath, 'ixbrlviewer.js')
    destination_js_path = os.path.join(ROOT, 'app', 'static', 'js', 'ixbrlviewer.js')
    
    # Create js directory if it doesn't exist
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(destination_js_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    args = f"--plugins=ixbrl-viewer -f {output_file} --save-viewer {viewer_filepath} --viewer-url {viewer_url}"
    # ... rest of your function
```

2. Add logging to your `/viewer` route:
```python
@routes_bp.route('/viewer')
def view():
    session_id = session.get('session_id')
    if not session_id:
        current_app.logger.error("No session ID found")
        return "Session expired", 400
        
    session_template_path = os.path.join('static', 'sessions_data', session_id, 'output')
    full_path = os.path.join(current_app.root_path, session_template_path)
    
    if not os.path.isdir(full_path):
        current_app.logger.error(f"Directory not found: {full_path}")
        return "Directory not found", 404
        
    viewer_file = os.path.join(full_path, 'viewer.html')
    if not os.path.exists(viewer_file):
        current_app.logger.error(f"Viewer file not found: {viewer_file}")
        return "Viewer file not found", 404
        
    return send_from_directory(full_path, 'viewer.html')
```

3. Add error handling in your upload completion:
```python
@routes_bp.route('/upload/complete', methods=['GET'])
def successful_upload():
    session_id = request.args.get('session_id') or session.get('session_id')
    if not session_id:
        current_app.logger.error("No session ID in upload completion")
        return redirect(url_for('routes_bp.home'))

    try:
        viewer_path = os.path.join(current_app.root_path, 'static', 'sessions_data', session_id, 'output', 'viewer.html')
        if not os.path.exists(viewer_path):
            current_app.logger.error(f"Viewer not generated: {viewer_path}")
            return "Viewer generation failed", 500
            
        # ... rest of your function
```

After making these changes:
1. Check if ixbrlviewer.js is actually being copied to the static/js directory
2. Verify the viewer.html file exists in the session output directory
3. Look for any errors in your Flask application logs

Can you try these changes and let me know what you see in the logs?

---

_**User**_

to provide more context, i believe the /viewer route in @upload.html should just load viewer.html, what exactly is wrong with this? I want it to open the html file in iXBRL viewer

---

_**Assistant**_



The issue might be that the viewer.html needs both the iXBRL content and the viewer JavaScript to work properly. Let's modify the `/viewer` route to ensure it has access to both:

1. First, modify the link in `upload.html` to include the session_id:

```html:app/templates/site/upload.html
{% block card2 %}
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-header">View your machine-readable financial statement in browser</div>
        <div class="card-body text-center">
            <a href="/viewer?session_id={{ session_id }}" target="_blank">
                <button type="button" class="btn btn-michigan btn-lg">Click to view in browser</button>
            </a>
        </div>
    </div>
{% endblock %}
```

2. Then in your routes.py, ensure the viewer route can access both the HTML and JS:

```python:app/routes.py
@routes_bp.route('/viewer')
def view():
    session_id = request.args.get('session_id') or session.get('session_id')
    if not session_id:
        current_app.logger.error("No session ID found")
        return "Session expired", 400
        
    viewer_path = os.path.join('static', 'sessions_data', session_id, 'output')
    full_path = os.path.join(current_app.root_path, viewer_path)
    
    # Add logging to debug
    print(f"Looking for viewer in: {full_path}")
    print(f"Files in directory: {os.listdir(full_path) if os.path.exists(full_path) else 'directory not found'}")
    
    return send_from_directory(full_path, 'viewer.html')
```

This should help track down where the viewer files are being saved and if they're accessible. Can you try these changes and let me know what you see in the terminal output when clicking the "View in browser" button?

---

_**User**_

my ixbrlviewer.js is stored in @js i think

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's check where your ixbrlviewer.js is actually being stored. In your current `xbrl_processing.py`, you have:

```python:app/utils/xbrl_processing.py
    # Move the ixbrlviewer.js file
    viewer_js_path = os.path.join(viewer_outpath, 'ixbrlviewer.js')
    destination_js_path = 'app/static/js/ixbrlviewer.js'
```

This looks correct - it's moving the JS file to `app/static/js/`. The issue might be in the viewer HTML file not finding this JS file correctly. Can you check:

1. Does the file exist at `app/static/js/ixbrlviewer.js`?
2. Can you show me what the generated viewer.html file looks like? (specifically the `<script>` tag that loads ixbrlviewer.js)

This will help us confirm if the paths are set up correctly.

---

_**User**_

1. yes the file exists at app/static/js/ixbrlviewer.js
2. this is what the viewer.html looks like:
-BEGIN IXBRL VIEWER EXTENSIONS--><script src="/static/js/ixbrlviewer.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="application/x.ixbrl-viewer+json">{

---

_**Assistant**_



The script tag in your viewer.html looks correct since it's pointing to `/static/js/ixbrlviewer.js`. 

Looking back at the suggested modification, we don't need to change the paths since your current setup in `xbrl_processing.py` is working correctly:

```python
viewer_js_path = os.path.join(viewer_outpath, 'ixbrlviewer.js')
destination_js_path = 'app/static/js/ixbrlviewer.js'
```

The issue might be elsewhere. Could you:
1. Check the browser's developer tools (Network tab) when loading the viewer to see if it's trying to load ixbrlviewer.js and if there are any 404 errors?
2. Share the complete viewer.html file to see if there are any other missing dependencies?

---

_**User**_

1. I do see an error in the network tab when i go to /viewer
here's the error:
Uncaught TypeError: t.forEach is not a function
    at ec.setFeatures (ixbrlviewer.js:2:795845)
    at ixbrlviewer.js:2:798153

2. the full viewer.html is in /process-xbrl/app/static/sessions_data/5b461cc9-8049-46c3-8799-a80499a6c287/output/viewer.html


---

_**Assistant**_



The error `Uncaught TypeError: t.forEach is not a function` suggests that the viewer is expecting an array but receiving something else. This could be related to how the features are being passed to the viewer.

Looking at your viewer.html from earlier, I noticed this section:

```javascript
"features": {
  "review": false
}
```

The features object should be an array, not an object. Let's modify the viewer creation in `xbrl_processing.py`:

```python:app/utils/xbrl_processing.py
def create_viewer_html(output_file, viewer_outpath):
    viewer_filepath = os.path.join(ROOT, viewer_outpath, 'viewer.html')
    
    # Use CDN version of viewer.js that expects correct feature format
    viewer_url = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ixbrl-viewer@1.4.36/iXBRLViewerPlugin/viewer/dist/ixbrlviewer.js"
    
    # Add --feature-review=false to ensure features are passed correctly
    args = f"--plugins=ixbrl-viewer -f {output_file} --save-viewer {viewer_filepath} --viewer-url {viewer_url} --feature-review=false"
    
    setApplicationLocale()
    gettext.install("arelle")
    print("Validating XBRL...")
    parseAndRun(shlex.split(args))
```

This modification should help ensure the features are passed in the correct format that the viewer.js expects. The key change is adding `--feature-review=false` to the args.

---

_**User**_

setting that to false causes all sorts of errors. 
I see this in terminal:


In browser console i see the following errors:
spinner.js:183

_**Assistant**_



Let's remove the `--feature-review` flag since it's causing errors. The main issues appear to be:

1. Upload errors in spinner.js
2. Network errors during file processing

Let's modify your code:

1. First, in `xbrl_processing.py`:
```python:app/utils/xbrl_processing.py
def create_viewer_html(output_file, viewer_outpath):
    viewer_filepath = os.path.join(ROOT, viewer_outpath, 'viewer.html')
    viewer_url = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ixbrl-viewer@1.4.36/iXBRLViewerPlugin/viewer/dist/ixbrlviewer.js"
    
    args = f"--plugins=ixbrl-viewer -f {output_file} --save-viewer {viewer_filepath} --viewer-url {viewer_url}"
    
    print('viewer path', viewer_filepath)
    args = shlex.split(args)
    setApplicationLocale()
    gettext.install("arelle")
    print("Validating XBRL...")
    try:
        parseAndRun(args)
        print("XBRL validation complete")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during XBRL validation: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

2. Add error handling to your `/upload` route:
```python:app/routes.py
@routes_bp.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    try:
        # ... existing code ...
        
        yield "data: Creating viewer\n\n"
        viewer_output_path = f'app/static/sessions_data/{session_id}/output/'
        try:
            create_viewer_html(output_file, viewer_output_path)
            print('viewer created\n')
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error creating viewer: {str(e)}")
            yield f"data: Error creating viewer: {str(e)}\n\n"
            return

        # ... rest of code ...
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Upload error: {str(e)}")
        yield f"data: Error during upload: {str(e)}\n\n"
```

Can you try these changes and let me know what errors you see in:
1. The terminal output
2. The browser console
3. The network tab in developer tools

This will help us identify where exactly the process is failing.

---

_**User**_

this is my terminal output
no errors on browser console other than Uncaught TypeError: t.forEach is not a function
    at ec.setFeatures (ixbrlviewer.js:2:795845)
    at ixbrlviewer.js:2:798153

---

_**Assistant**_



Looking at your terminal output and the error, everything seems to be working correctly up until the viewer tries to initialize. The `t.forEach` error suggests the viewer is receiving malformed data.

Let's check the viewer configuration in `xbrl_processing.py`. Can you show me:

1. The content of your generated viewer.html file (specifically the part that contains the viewer configuration JSON)? It should look something like this:
```html
<script type="application/x.ixbrl-viewer+json">
{
  "features": [...],
  ...
}
</script>
```

2. The version of ixbrl-viewer you're using? In your code it should be specified in the `viewer_url` variable.

This will help us identify if the issue is with the viewer configuration or the version compatibility.

I see the issue now. The `features` in your viewer.html is an object:
```json
"features": {
  "review": false
}
```

But it should be an array. Let's modify the viewer URL in `xbrl_processing.py` to try a different version that might be more compatible:

```python:app/utils/xbrl_processing.py
def create_viewer_html(output_file, viewer_outpath):
    viewer_filepath = os.path.join(ROOT, viewer_outpath, 'viewer.html')
    
    # Try an older version of the viewer
    viewer_url = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ixbrl-viewer@1.3.0/iXBRLViewerPlugin/viewer/dist/ixbrlviewer.js"
    
    print('viewer path', viewer_filepath)
    args = f"--plugins=ixbrl-viewer -f {output_file} --save-viewer {viewer_filepath} --viewer-url {viewer_url}"
    
    # ... rest of your function
```

Let's try version 1.3.0 instead of 1.4.36 to see if this resolves the `forEach` error. The newer version might have different expectations for the features format.
