## Purpose of the Template:

This Excel template is designed to streamline the preparation and conversion of financial statements into the XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) format. By following the steps, you can efficiently complete the process while minimizing errors.

## Key Features and How They Work:

### Highlighted Inputs at the Top of the Master Info Sheet:

- Municipality, State, Fiscal Year: These fields are required for identification purposes.
- Business Type Activities, Component Units, Footnotes (Y/N):
- Choosing "Y" or "N" will automatically enable or hide certain fields and sheets relevant to your financial statement type.
- For example:
- If "Y" is selected for Business Type Activities, additional sections for proprietary fund reporting will appear.
- If "N" is chosen for Component Units, sheets and sections related to component units will be disabled or hidden.
- These fields ensure you only interact with applicable portions of the template, reducing unnecessary complexity.
	
### Financial Statement Sheets (Net Position, PropFunds, Statement of Activities, etc.):

- Each sheet corresponds to a specific section of the financial report.
- Input fields are pre-defined with cell references and formulas to guide accurate data entry.
- Most sheets include automatic lookup formulas that correspond to the drop down menu of ACFR tags relating to each section. Choose the options that are closest to your entry or type in a custom tag.

### Built-In Data Validation:

- Post-conversion, it’s crucial to verify the XBRL output to ensure data accuracy.
- Common errors might include missing fields, incorrect formatting, or mismatched totals, which should be corrected in the Excel file and re-uploaded.

## Why the Template is Designed This Way:

- Modularity: The Y/N questions tailor the template to your municipality’s specific requirements, making it flexible.
- User-Friendly: Highlighted input fields and dropdown menus simplify navigation for users with varying expertise levels.
- Error Prevention: Built-in checks, formulas, and lookup functions reduce the chances of human error.
- Streamlined Workflow: Clearly defined steps ensure a logical sequence, from data entry to review and submission.
- Standardization: Pre-formatted sections align with XBRL standards, minimizing the effort required for conversion.
