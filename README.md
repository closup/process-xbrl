## Purpose

An open-source tool to convert ACFR files in Excel and Word into inline XBRL

## Demo

View the app on Heroku here: [https://xbrl-converter-22f50351e04c.herokuapp.com/](https://xbrl-converter-22f50351e04c.herokuapp.com/)
or embedded on the CLOSUP site here: [https://closup.umich.edu/acfr-tool](https://closup.umich.edu/acfr-tool)

## To Run Locally

1. Package requirements are listed in requirements.txt; create a new virtual environment and download these using pip:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Initialize submodules:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
3. Run the main.py script:
```
python3 main.py
```
4. This will launch a Flask server -- open a web browser and navigate to the address given in the terminal output (http://127.0.0.1:8080/)
5. You can test the functionality by uploading the sample file where prompted on the app: `static/input_files/samples/Clayton_sample.xlsx`

## Running into issues?
There may be an issue with FLASK_SECRET_KEY. If you are running into issues, generate a .env file and set the FLASK_SECRET_KEY to a 32 character string that can be generated via `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(16))"` in terminal.
