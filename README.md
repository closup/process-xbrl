## Purpose

An open-source tool to convert Excel into XBRL

### Demo

View the app on Heroku here: https://xbrl-converter-22f50351e04c.herokuapp.com/

## To Run Locally

1. Package requirements are listed in requirements.txt; create a new virtual environment and download these using pip
2. Running the main.py script will launch a Flask server -- open a web browser and navigate to the address given in the terminal output (http://127.0.0.1:8080/)
3. See functionality by uploading `static/input_files/samples/Clayton.xlsx`
4. The static ixbrl file will be saved in `static/output/output.html` and the viewer will be saved in `static/output/ixbrl-viwer.html` (with the corresponding Javascript in `static/js/ixbrlviwer.js`)
